## Steps

1. Open the `notebook_interactive.ipnyb`
2. Run each block (only assumption is made that the data i.e. xls sheet to be converted should be placed in data folder of current working directory )
3. Output xls files generated in `output` folder

**NOTE** :- This code only works for old format xls files
